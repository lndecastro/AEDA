# 5 — Data Visualization Methods

This module presents the **main data visualization methods used in Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (AEDA)**. While Module 4 focused on *principles* of visualization, this module focuses on *methods*: which visual representations to use depending on the analytical goal and the nature of the data.

The methods are organized according to the analytical questions they help answer: **distributions, associations, amounts, proportions, evolution and flow, and geospatial data**.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. Select appropriate visualization methods based on data type and analytical goal.  
2. Interpret distributions, associations, and patterns using visual representations.  
3. Compare variables using appropriate quantitative and categorical charts.  
4. Analyze temporal evolution, flows, and spatial patterns visually.  
5. Avoid common misuses of visualization methods in exploratory analysis.

## 5.1 Visualization Selection Guide

This program adopts a categorization of visualization methods that considers the type of data and visualization generated by the graphs, as follows:
- **Distribution**: Distribution graphs are used to show how the values of a variable are spread across their range. They help us understand the shape, center, variability, and presence of outliers in the data. Common examples include histograms, boxplots, and violin plots.
- **Associations**: Association graphs are used to visualize relationships between two or more variables. They allow us to explore patterns, trends, correlations, clusters, and anomalies in the data. Typical examples include scatter plots, scatterplot matrices, heatmaps, correlograms, and bubble charts.
- **Amounts**: Amount graphs are used to compare the magnitude of values across categories or variables. They are useful for identifying differences and rankings. Examples include bar charts, radar charts, and word clouds.
- **Proportions**: Proportion graphs show how a whole is divided into parts based on their relative contribution. These visualizations emphasize percentages or shares rather than absolute values. Common examples include pie charts, doughnut charts, treemaps, sunburst charts, and dendrograms.
- **Evolution and Flow**: Evolution graphs are used to represent how numeric values change over time, while flow graphs illustrate movement or transitions between stages or categories. Examples include line charts, area charts, Sankey diagrams, and Gantt charts.
- **Geospatial**: Geospatial graphs are used to visualize data associated with geographic locations. They help identify spatial patterns and regional differences. Typical examples include choropleth maps and bubble maps.

**Figure:** Categories of data visualization methods.

Use the table below as a **quick guide** to select a visualization method based on the analytical question, the data type, and the main interpretation goal.

| Analytical goal | Typical data | Recommended charts | Best for | Common pitfalls |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Understand a distribution** | 1 quantitative variable (continuous) | Histogram, Boxplot, Violin | Shape, spread, skewness, outliers | Too many bins / too few bins; hiding outliers via axis truncation |
| **Compare distributions across groups** | 1 quantitative + 1 categorical | Boxplot, Violin | Group comparison, outliers, multimodality | Ignoring sample size per group; overplotting with too many categories |
| **Study association (2 variables)** | 2 quantitative variables | Scatter plot | Direction, strength, clusters, outliers | Overplotting; using lines for unordered categories |
| **Study association (3–4 variables)** | 2 quantitative + size (quant) + color (cat/quant) | Bubble chart | Multivariate patterns at a glance | Misleading area encoding; hard comparisons when bubble sizes vary too much |
| **Inspect many pairwise associations** | Many quantitative variables | Pair plot (scatterplot matrix) | Correlation patterns and anomalies | Too many variables → clutter; interpreting correlation as causation |
| **Summarize a matrix of values** | Tabular matrix / correlation matrix | Heatmap, Correlogram | Patterns in matrices, correlation structure | Poor colormap choice; not centering correlations at 0; missing annotation/scale |
| **Compare amounts across categories** | Categorical + quantitative | Bar chart | Clear magnitude comparisons | Unsorted bars; too many categories; truncated axes |
| **Compare profiles across dimensions** | Multiple quantitative variables per entity | Radar chart (careful) | Quick “profile” shape comparison | Difficult precise comparison; poor for many entities; scale differences distort shape |
| **Show parts of a whole** | Categorical proportions | Pie/Doughnut (few categories), Treemap (many/hierarchical) | Share of total, hierarchy | Too many slices; comparing angles is hard; hiding small values |
| **Show evolution over time** | Time series | Line chart | Trend, seasonality, change points | Smoothing hides structure; missing time aggregation; too many lines |
| **Show flows between stages** | Source → target with amounts | Sankey chart | Movement of quantities | Too many nodes/links; ordering issues; hard to read without grouping |
| **Show project schedule** | Tasks with start/end dates | Gantt chart | Task duration and overlap | Too many tasks without grouping; missing dependencies/context |
| **Show spatial variation by region** | Geographic polygons + numeric value | Choropleth map | Regional intensity patterns | Mapping counts instead of rates; class breaks/scale choices mislead |
| **Show spatial quantities at points** | Geographic points + numeric value | Bubble map | Location-based magnitude | Bubble overlap; area vs radius confusion; missing basemap context |

## 5.1 Distributions

Distribution plots are used to **understand how values of a variable are spread across their range**, including shape, center, variability, and outliers.

### 5.1.1 Histogram

**Purpose:**  
To explore and visualize the distribution of a single variable.

**Common type of data:**  
Continuous quantitative data.

**Interpretation:**  
The histogram divides the data range into bins and displays the frequency (absolute or relative) of values in each bin. Interpretation focuses on:
- Shape (symmetric, skewed, multimodal)
- Central tendency
- Spread
- Presence of gaps and outliers

### 5.1.2 Boxplot (Box-and-Whisker Plot)

**Purpose:**  
To visualize and compare distributions using the **five-number summary**.

**Common type of data:**  
Continuous quantitative data.

**Five-number summary:**  
- Minimum  
- First quartile $Q_1$  
- Median $Q_2$  
- Third quartile $Q_3$  
- Maximum  

**Outlier detection:**  
Values are often considered outliers if <p>
$x < Q_1 - \gamma \cdot IQR \quad \text{or} \quad x > Q_3 + \gamma \cdot IQR$ <p>
where $IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$ and typically $\gamma = 1.5$.

#### Python Code — Boxplot and Histogram

```python
# CODE 5.1
# Box plot and histogram for a normal distribution

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as spy
import seaborn as sns

# Generate the random sample data
np.random.seed()
data = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=1000)

# Calculate the summary measures
q1, q2, q3 = np.percentile(data, [25, 50, 75])
iqr = q3 - q1
upper_whisker = q3 + 1.5*iqr; lower_whisker = q1 - 1.5*iqr
max_val = np.max(data); min_val = np.min(data)
midpoint = (max_val+min_val)/2
k = spy.kurtosis(data); s = spy.skew(data)

# Plot the boxplot and print the values (Q1, Q2, Q3) on the first subplot
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(10,5))
bp = ax1.boxplot(data)
ax1.set_title(f"IQR: {iqr:.2f}", fontsize=16)
ax1.text(0.9, q1, f'Q1: {q1:.2f}', ha='right', va='center', fontsize=14)
ax1.text(0.9, q2, f'Q2: {q2:.2f}', ha='right', va='center', fontsize=14)
ax1.text(0.9, q3, f'Q3: {q3:.2f}', ha='right', va='center', fontsize=14)

# Plot the histogram on the second subplot
sns.histplot(data, bins='auto', ax=ax2)
plt.axvline(x=upper_whisker, color='k', linestyle=':')
plt.axvline(x=lower_whisker, color='k', linestyle=':')

plt.title(f"Kurtosis: {k:.2f},  Skewness: {s: .2f}")
plt.show()
```

#### Prompt — Boxplot and Histogram
```
You are a data visualization assistant supporting an **Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (AEDA)** course.

Your task is to **illustrate the distribution of a continuous variable drawn from a normal distribution** using complementary visualizations.

### High-Level Objectives

1. Generate a synthetic dataset that follows a **normal (Gaussian) distribution**.
2. Visually analyze the distribution using **two side-by-side plots**:
   - A **box-and-whisker plot** to summarize the distribution using quartiles and dispersion.
   - A **histogram** to show the overall shape and frequency of values.
3. Ensure the two plots are presented **in the same figure**, allowing direct comparison between:
   - Numerical summary information (via the boxplot), and
   - Distributional shape (via the histogram).
4. Clearly communicate key characteristics of the distribution, including:
   - Central tendency and spread (via quartiles and IQR),
   - Potential outliers (via whiskers),
   - Shape-related properties such as **skewness** and **kurtosis**.
5. Annotate the visualizations so that a student can easily interpret:
   - The quartile values in the boxplot, and
   - Distributional properties in the histogram.

### Expected Outcome

Produce a single figure with:
- A **boxplot** highlighting quartiles and interquartile range.
- A **histogram** showing the distribution of the same data.
- Informative titles and annotations that reinforce how summary statistics and visual structure complement each other in exploratory data analysis.

The emphasis should be on **conceptual clarity and interpretability**, not on implementation details or low-level plotting mechanics.
```


> **Note:** In this module we are going to use a different style of prompts when compared with the prompts developed in the previous module. This is to illustrate that although we keep the general structure of the prompt, it is possible to create them in different ways and obtain similar (equivalent) results.

- Displays a **violin plot with data points** for the same variable and groups.
- Enables students to visually compare:
  - Summary statistics versus distribution shape,
  - Group differences in central tendency and variability,
  - The added value of combining summary-based and density-based visualizations in exploratory data analysis.

The emphasis should be on **conceptual understanding and interpretability**, not on implementation details or low-level plotting mechanics.
```

## 5.2 Associations

Association plots visualize **relationships between two or more variables**.

### 5.2.1 Scatter Plot

**Purpose:**  
To visualize the relationship between two variables.

**Common type of data:**  
Continuous variables on both axes.

- Includes a visual indication of the **overall trend** in the data,
- Allows students to visually assess:
  - Direction of association (positive or negative),
  - Strength and form of the relationship,
  - Presence of clusters or outliers.

The emphasis should be on **conceptual understanding of variable association and visual interpretation**, rather than on implementation details or low-level plotting mechanics.
```

### 5.2.2 Bubble Chart

**Purpose:**  
To visualize the relationship between **two quantitative variables**, while incorporating an additional quantitative dimension through **bubble size** (and optionally a categorical or quantitative dimension through color).

**Common type of data:**  
- x-axis: continuous quantitative variable  
- y-axis: continuous quantitative variable  
- bubble size: quantitative variable representing magnitude  
- bubble color (optional): categorical groups or quantitative intensity  

**Interpretation:**  
- Direction and strength of association between the two main variables  
- How the third variable varies across the x–y space, as indicated by bubble size  
- Group patterns or segmentation when color is used  
- Presence of clusters, gaps, and outliers, including unusually large or small bubbles  

#### Python Code — Bubble chart (Gapminder dataset example)

```python
# CODE 5.3
# Bubble charts with four variables for the Gapminder and Auto MPG datasets

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set plot features
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=1, figsize=(10, 13))

# Create a bubble chart for the Gapminder dataset
sns.scatterplot(data=dgapminder, x="hdi_index", y="life_exp", hue="continent", 
                size="co2_consump", sizes=(20, 500), alpha=0.7, ax=ax1)
ax1.set_xlabel("HDI Index", fontsize=14, labelpad=6.0)
ax1.set_ylabel("Life Expectancy", fontsize=14, labelpad=6.0)
ax1.set_title("Life Expectancy vs HDI Index by Continent (Bubble size is CO2 Consumption)", fontsize=16, pad=15.0)
ax1.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc=2, borderaxespad=0.)

# Create a bubble chart for the Auto MPG dataset

ax2.set_xlabel("Acceleration", fontsize=14, labelpad=6.0)
ax2.set_ylabel("MPG", fontsize=14, labelpad=6.0)
ax2.set_title("MPG vs Acceleration by Cylinders (Bubble size represents HP)", fontsize=16, pad=15.0)
ax2.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc=2, borderaxespad=0.)

# Adjust the layout to add space between subplots
plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.3)
plt.show()
```

![Fig5_5 — Bubble Chart](./Data/Figure_5_7_Bubble_Chart.jpg)

#### Prompt — Bubble chart (Gapminder dataset example)

```
You are a data visualization assistant supporting an **Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (AEDA)** course.

Your task is to **analyze multivariate relationships using bubble charts**, where multiple variables are encoded simultaneously in a single visualization.

## High-Level Objectives

1. Use two real-world datasets containing **continuous and categorical variables** from different application domains.
2. For each dataset, select **four variables** and encode them visually as follows:
   - Two continuous variables mapped to the **x-axis** and **y-axis**,
   - One quantitative variable represented by **bubble size**,
   - One categorical variable represented by **color**.
3. Create a **single figure composed of two vertically stacked bubble charts**, one for each dataset, to allow comparison across contexts.
4. Ensure each bubble chart:
   - Clearly communicates the relationship between the two main quantitative variables,
   - Uses bubble size to convey an additional magnitude-related dimension,
   - Uses color to distinguish categories or groups.
5. Include clear axis labels, legends, and titles that explicitly explain:
   - What variables are being compared,
   - What bubble size and color represent,
   - How to interpret the visual encoding.

## Expected Outcome

Produce a single, well-organized figure containing:
- A **bubble chart** illustrating relationships among four variables for the first dataset,
- A second **bubble chart** illustrating relationships among four variables for a different dataset,
- Legends and titles that make the multivariate encoding explicit.

The resulting visualizations should allow students to:
- Explore complex multivariate relationships at a glance,
- Compare patterns, clusters, and outliers across groups,
- Understand how bubble charts extend scatter plots by incorporating additional dimensions.

The emphasis should be on **conceptual understanding of multivariate visualization and interpretability**, not on implementation details or low-level plotting mechanics.
```

### 5.2.3 Scatterplot Matrix (Pair Plot)

**Purpose:**  
To visualize pairwise relationships among multiple variables.

**Common type of data:**
Multiple continuous quantitative variables (numeric features). Optionally, one categorical variable used for color grouping (e.g., class/species)

**Interpretation:**
- Pairwise association patterns across all variable pairs
- Direction (positive, negative, none) and strength of relationships
- Clusters and group separation when color encodes categories
- Outliers and unusual observations that appear across multiple projections
- Redundancy or collinearity between variables (highly similar patterns across plots)

#### Python Code — Pair plot (Iris example)

```python
# CODE 5.4
# Scatterplot matrix for the Iris dataset

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load the Iris dataset from scikit-learn
iris = load_iris()

# Convert the dataset to a Pandas DataFrame
diris = sns.load_dataset('iris')

# Pairplot
sns.set_style("white")
grid1 = sns.pairplot(diris) # Distributions
grid2 = sns.pairplot(diris, hue='species') # Kernel density estimate (KDE)
plt.show()
```

![Scatterplot Matrix](./Data/Figure_5_8a_Scatterplot_Matrix.jpg)
![Scatterplot Matrix](./Data/Figure_5_8b_Scatterplot_Matrix.jpg)

#### Prompt — Pair plot (Iris example)
```
You are a data visualization assistant supporting an **Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (AEDA)** course.

Your task is to **explore and communicate multivariate relationships using scatterplot matrices (pair plots)** for a well-known benchmark dataset.

## High-Level Objectives

2. Create a **scatterplot matrix** that displays all pairwise relationships among the continuous variables.
3. Generate two complementary views:
   - A scatterplot matrix showing **univariate distributions on the diagonal** and **pairwise scatter plots off the diagonal**.
   - A scatterplot matrix enhanced with **color-coded groups** to distinguish categories and reveal class structure.
4. Ensure the visualizations support interpretation by:
   - Making it easy to compare relationships across many variable pairs,
   - Highlighting patterns of association, redundancy, and separation between groups,
   - Revealing clusters, overlaps, and outliers across multiple projections.

## Expected Outcome

Produce visualizations that:
- Present a **complete pairwise overview** of relationships among all numeric variables,
- Show how adding a categorical grouping variable (via color) changes interpretation,
- Allow students to identify:
  - Direction and strength of pairwise associations,
  - Variable pairs that best separate groups,
  - Potential multicollinearity or redundancy among features.

The emphasis should be on **multivariate exploratory insight and visual reasoning**, not on implementation details or plotting mechanics.
```

### 5.2.4 Heatmaps and Correlograms

**Purpose:**  
To visualize magnitude (often correlation) using color intensity.

**Common type of data:**
A matrix of numerical values, typically derived from multiple quantitative variables (especially for correlograms).

**Interpretation:**
- Strength (and sign, when applicable) of relationships between variable pairs
- Groups of variables that behave similarly (blocks or clusters in the matrix)
- Redundancy / multicollinearity (strong correlations among predictors)
- Weak or near-zero relationships that suggest independence
- Potential anomalies or unusual patterns in structured data matrices

#### Python Code — Correlation heatmap (Iris example)

# Create a subplot grid with 2 rows and 1 column
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(8, 12))
        
# Correlation heatmap for Iris dataset
corr_iris = diris.corr()
cmap_inverted = sns.color_palette("coolwarm", as_cmap=True)
cmap_inverted = cmap_inverted.reversed()
sns.heatmap(corr_iris, annot=True, cmap=cmap_inverted, ax=axs[0])
axs[0].set_title('Iris Correlation Heatmap', fontsize=16)

# Correlation heatmap for the Forest Fires dataset
corr_forest = dforest.corr()

# Set tick labels font size & rotation
for ax in axs:
    ax.tick_params(axis='y', labelrotation=0.0)
    ax.tick_params(labelsize=11)
    
plt.show()

- Allows students to visually compare:
  - Strength and sign of correlations within each dataset,
  - Structural differences in variable relationships across datasets,
  - Patterns of redundancy, independence, and potential multicollinearity.

The emphasis should be on **conceptual understanding of correlation structure and visual interpretation**, not on implementation details or plotting mechanics.
```

## 5.3 Amounts

Amount plots compare **absolute magnitudes across categories**.

### 5.3.1 Bar Chart

**Purpose:**  
To compare quantities (amounts) across **discrete categories**.

**Common type of data:**  
- x-axis: categorical or discrete variable (groups, labels, bins)  
- y-axis: quantitative variable (count, sum, mean, rate, etc.)  

**Interpretation:**  
- Which categories have the largest or smallest values  
- Magnitude differences between categories (gaps and rankings)  
- Overall pattern of variation across categories (e.g., dominance, balance)  
- Potential outliers or unusually large/small categories

#### Prompt — Bar chart 
```
You are a data visualization assistant supporting an **Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (AEDA)** course.

Your task is to **analyze and compare categorical amounts using bar charts** based on a real-world medical dataset containing diagnostic attributes.

## High-Level Objectives

1. Use a dataset composed of **categorical variables** related to medical diagnosis.
2. Focus on two categorical attributes:
   - A primary outcome variable representing **diagnostic severity**,
   - A descriptive categorical variable representing **mass shape**.
3. Generate a sequence of **bar chart visualizations** that progressively increase in complexity:
   - A **simple bar chart** showing the distribution (counts) of diagnostic severity.
   - A **grouped bar chart** comparing the distribution of severity across different shape categories.
   - A **combined categorical bar chart** showing counts for each unique combination of shape and severity.
4. Ensure all charts clearly communicate:
   - Category labels and counts,
   - Differences and contrasts between groups,
   - How categorical aggregation affects interpretation.

## Expected Outcome

Produce a set of bar chart figures that:
- Show the overall frequency of diagnostic severity categories,
- Compare severity outcomes across different shape categories using grouped bars,
- Display counts for combined categorical conditions in a single chart,
- Allow students to visually assess:
  - Dominant categories,
  - Group-level differences,
  - How categorical relationships can be explored through aggregation.

The emphasis should be on **conceptual understanding of categorical comparison and aggregation**, not on implementation details or low-level plotting mechanics.
```

### 5.3.2 Radar Chart

**Purpose:**  
To compare **multiple variables** (dimensions) for one or more entities using a radial layout.

**Common type of data:**  
- Multiple quantitative variables measured on the same scale (or normalized to a common scale)  
- One or more entities/records to compare (e.g., products, models, individuals, regions)

**Interpretation:**  
- Relative strengths and weaknesses across variables (profile shape)  
- Similarity or differences between entities by comparing polygon shapes  
- Variables where an entity performs unusually high or low  
- Overall balance or imbalance across dimensions (e.g., “spiky” vs. “rounded” profiles)  

> Radar charts should be used with care. They can be useful for a quick “profile” view, but they are not ideal for precise comparisons.

#### Python Code — Radar chart 

```python
# CODE 5.7
# Radar Chart for the Iris dataset available at the Scikitlearn library

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load the Iris dataset from Scikitlearn and setup the radar chart
diris = load_iris()
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
axs = fig.add_subplot(polar=True)
angles = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, len(diris.feature_names), endpoint=False)
angles = np.concatenate((angles,[angles[0]]))
line = ['-','--','-.']

# For each Iris class, plot the mean values of its features as a line 
for i in range(3):
    values = diris.data[diris.target == i].mean(axis=0)
    values = np.concatenate((values, [values[0]]))
    axs.plot(angles, values, label=diris.target_names[i], ls=line[i])
axs.set_xticks(angles[:-1])
axs.set_xticklabels(diris.feature_names)


axs.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.2, 1.05))
axs.set_title('Radar Chart for the Iris Dataset')
plt.show()
```

#### Prompt — Radar chart 
```
You are a data visualization assistant supporting an **Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (AEDA)** course.

Your task is to **compare multivariate profiles across multiple groups** using a radar (spider) chart.

## High-Level Objectives

1. Use a well-known multivariate dataset containing:
   - Several **continuous quantitative variables**, and
   - A **categorical grouping variable** defining multiple classes.
2. For each group, compute a **representative summary profile** (e.g., average values) across all quantitative variables.
3. Create a **single radar chart** where:
   - Each axis represents one quantitative variable,
   - Each group is represented by a distinct polygon or line.
4. Ensure the visualization supports comparison by:
   - Using a common scale across all variables,
   - Clearly distinguishing groups through line style or visual encoding,
   - Labeling all variables and groups clearly.

## Expected Outcome

Produce a single radar chart that:
- Displays the multivariate profile of each group in a radial layout,
- Allows students to visually compare:
  - Relative strengths and weaknesses across variables,
  - Similarities and differences between group profiles,
  - Overall balance or imbalance across dimensions.
- Reinforces how radar charts provide a **compact summary view** of multiple variables for comparative exploratory analysis.

The emphasis should be on **conceptual understanding of profile comparison and multivariate visualization**, not on implementation details or low-level plotting mechanics.
```

## 5.4 Proportions

Proportion plots show **how a whole is divided into parts**.

### 5.4.1 Pie Chart

**Purpose:**  
To show how a **whole** is divided into **parts**, where each slice represents a category’s proportion of the total.

**Common type of data:**  
- One categorical variable with a small number of categories  
- A quantitative measure that represents **counts** or **shares** per category (often frequencies)

**Interpretation:**  
- Relative contribution of each category to the total (largest vs. smallest slices)  
- Dominant categories and whether the distribution is balanced or concentrated  
- Whether small categories are negligible or meaningful (if visible/labeled)

#### Prompt — Pie chart and Bar Chart

```
You are a data visualization assistant supporting an **Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (AEDA)** course.

Your task is to **analyze and compare categorical proportions using complementary visualizations** across two real-world datasets from different application domains.

## High-Level Objectives

1. Use **two datasets** containing categorical variables that represent meaningful groupings:
   - One related to **medical diagnostic attributes**,
   - One related to **environmental or temporal conditions**.
2. For each dataset, focus on **one categorical variable** and examine how its categories are distributed.
3. Create a **single figure organized as a 2 × 2 grid** of plots, where each row corresponds to one dataset:
   - A **pie chart** to visualize the relative proportions of categories as parts of a whole,
   - A **bar chart** to display the same information using percentages for easier comparison.
4. Ensure consistency between paired plots by:
   - Using the same underlying data for the pie chart and the bar chart,
   - Expressing bar chart values as **percentages**,
   - Ordering categories meaningfully to support interpretation.
5. Clearly label all plots with informative titles and axis annotations so that students can easily understand:
   - What variable is being visualized,
   - How categories contribute to the total,
   - How different visualization types affect interpretability.

## Expected Outcome

Produce a single, well-structured figure that:
- Displays **pie charts** showing the proportional breakdown of categories for each dataset,
- Displays corresponding **bar charts** showing the same proportions using percentages,
- Enables students to compare:
  - Pie charts versus bar charts for representing proportions,
  - Distribution patterns across different datasets,
  - The advantages and limitations of each visualization type for proportion data.

The emphasis should be on **conceptual understanding of proportion-based visualizations and comparative interpretation**, not on implementation details or low-level plotting mechanics.
```

### 5.4.2 Doughnut Chart

**Purpose:**  
A variation of the pie chart that shows proportions of a whole, but with a **hollow center** that can be used for labels or summary information.

**Common type of data:**  
- One categorical variable with a small number of categories  
- A quantitative measure representing **counts** or **shares** per category (often frequencies)

**Interpretation:**  
- Relative contribution of each category to the total (largest vs. smallest segments)  
- Overall balance or concentration of the distribution  
- Optional center label can reinforce a key total or KPI (e.g., total count, overall rate)  

#### Python Code — Doughnut chart

## Reflection

Visualization methods are not interchangeable. Each method answers specific analytical questions and carries assumptions about data type and structure. Reflect on how choosing an inappropriate visualization can distort interpretation and mislead decision-making. Also reflect on how visual methods complement (and sometimes outperform) summary statistics when the goal is to understand structure, patterns, and anomalies.
